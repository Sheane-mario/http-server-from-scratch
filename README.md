# Minimal HTTP Server in C

Welcome to my custom-built HTTP server developed in pure C! This project was created as part of a systems-level networking assignment to explore how HTTP servers function under the hood. It demonstrates low-level socket programming, request parsing, and simple HTTP response handling â€” all without relying on high-level web frameworks.
