# Minimal HTTP Server in C

Welcome to my custom-built HTTP server developed in pure C! This project was created as part of a systems-level networking assignment to explore how HTTP servers function under the hood. It demonstrates low-level socket programming, request parsing, and simple HTTP response handling â€” all without relying on high-level web frameworks.

# ðŸš€ Features Implemented

âœ… Request Parsing â€“ Efficiently parses raw HTTP requests to extract the method, path, headers, and body.
âœ… Endpoint Routing â€“ Supports multiple endpoints with specific behavior:

`/` â€“ Returns a simple success response.

`/user-agent` â€“ Extracts and responds with the User-Agent header from the request.

`/echo/<message>` â€“ Responds with the message provided in the URL.

`/files/<filename>` â€“ Serves files from a user-defined directory (GET) and allows file creation via POST.

âœ… Content-Encoding Detection â€“ Detects if the client accepts gzip encoding and adjusts the response headers accordingly.
âœ… Custom File Directory Support â€“ Accepts a `--directory` command-line argument to serve and store files in a specified location.
âœ… Basic Error Handling â€“ Sends appropriate 404 Not Found or 500 Internal Server Error responses when needed.
âœ… HTTP Response Templates â€“ Dynamically builds responses with correct headers and content-lengths.

# ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

Language: C
Networking: POSIX sockets (TCP)
Compilation: gcc
OS: Built and tested on Linux

# ðŸ§ª Usage

```c
gcc -o http_server server.c
./http_server --directory ./files
```

Use curl or any HTTP client to test the endpoints.

# ðŸ“‚ Example Requests

```bash
curl http://localhost:4221/
curl http://localhost:4221/user-agent
curl http://localhost:4221/echo/hello-world
curl -X POST --data "some content" http://localhost:4221/files/test.txt
curl http://localhost:4221/files/test.txt
```

# ðŸ“Œ Note

This project is built for educational purposes to understand the internals of an HTTP server. It's minimal, synchronous, and handles one request at a time â€” perfect for grasping the foundational ideas of networking and HTTP
